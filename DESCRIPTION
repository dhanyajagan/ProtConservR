Description: ProtConservR is an R package for analyzing and visualizing protein 
    sequence conservation. It provides functions to (1) Read and process protein 
    sequences from FASTA files, (2) Create multiple sequence alignments using 
    MUSCLE or ClustalW. (3) Calculate position-specific conservation scores based 
    on shannon entropy. (4) Map conservation scores to protein structure data. 
    (5) Create plots and interactive visualizations of conservation data, including
    line plots of conservation scores across residues, heatmaps of conservation 
    scores, and 3D visualizations of protein structure colored by conservation.
