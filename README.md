# ProtConservR
ProtConservR is a tool for analyzing the sequence conservation of various protein families specific to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and other select protein families, and aims to map sequence conservation onto protein structure, to understand which parts of protein structure are evolutionarily conserved, which can potentially provide insight into functionally important regions.
